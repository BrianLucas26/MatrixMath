# MatrixMath 
This is a tool I created using Java Swift to conduct matrix operation, inspired by my lack of desire to complete my linear algebra homework. Currently supports add, subtract, multiply, and inverse operations. 
## How it works
When running the program, the first UI that opens will prompt the user to select the operation of their choosing.

This will open another UI for the user to input the matrices that will be undergoing the operation previously selected. After inputting the matrix or matrices, hit Go! to display the result. The following snips show the result of an add operation.
